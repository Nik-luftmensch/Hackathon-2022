# GraphQL

The GraphQL specification is edited in the markdown files found in
[`/spec`](./spec) the latest release of which is published at
https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/.

The latest draft specification can be found at
https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/draft/ which tracks the latest commit to
the main branch in this repository.

Previous releases of the GraphQL specification can be found at permalinks that
match their [release tag](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/releases). For
example, https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/October2016/. If you are linking
directly to the GraphQL specification, it's best to link to a tagged permalink
for the particular referenced version.
